# HeartbreAKA Website

## About the Client

The Elegant Eta Beta Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA) Sorority, Incorporated is a service organization to both Vanderbilt and the greater Nashville community. They plan and host events surrounding their current targets set by their International President. Some of their most well-known annual events include Chicken & Waffles, HeartbreAKA, and Taste of AKA. The members also serve the community by helping out at local food banks, collecting donations for worldwide charity organizations, and beautifying Nashville with new greenery.

## Scope of the Project 

The HeartbreAKA website is an online auction site designed to facilitate the bidding and “matchmaking” of bachelors in the event and the attendees. This auction will be live and bidding will be done directly through the website. The auction is a timed event where attendees are bidding against one another to go on a date with the bachelor provided by the charitable organization Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated. The event is usually held during the first week of February. This date is pending approval due to Covid-19.  The expected attendance of the event is to be around 300 participants. Our preliminary requirement analysis gave us insight into the features and functionality the website needs beyond the auction. 
The website is to include an information page dedicated to the history and purpose of The Elegant Eta Beta Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated. Another information page is to be dedicated to the history of the HeartbreAKA event along with information about the charitable organization that the donations/bids are being collected for. The website is tentatively supposed to be used annually for the auction event. It is tentatively to be used as a chapter information page outside of the auction event. Below is a list of functionality and features requested by the client:
  - Information for charity
  - Google form to collect bachelor information
  - Running total of donations/bids
  - Incremental bidding
  - Donation to bidding value conversion
  - About us page (chapter positions, contact information, instagram and email links)
  - What is HeartbreAKA ?
  - Streaming donations directly to chapter accounts (Cashapp, Venmo, Paypal??)
  - Each bachelor gets an about me page (Including picture and information)
  - Bachelor page that expands when bachelors pictures are clicked
  - Logo

Each of these features and functions will be implemented by Dec 10, 2020. These features were collected during the client interview process. An interview transcript will be attached to the end of this report.
